# quick-start-dcp
This script is used to quickly open DCP in a specific directory

# Description
This is a script that I personally use to quickly open VS Code from Visual Studio's Developer Command Prompt with a specific working directory.

I simplified it so that it only opens DCP in the location you want, it's up to you to customize it to do what you want afterwards!
